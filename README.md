### PROJECT OVERVIEW

Data is crucial not just for assessing the global impact of COVID-19, but also for informing appropriate reaction, planning, and resource allocation. The pandemic has highlighted the value of data more than anything else.

Covid-19 Updates aims to provide updated data of confirmed Covid-19 cases and vaccine rate per country. It can cater to the general public users, the government, especially the tourism sector. Given that data organization is its foundation, it would deliver a systematized flow of information to the user. As a result, it helps provide information about how a country is doing in terms of the Corona virus infection and protection. 

The data structure should be easy to understand for general public users, and the site should be able to provide country filters, a bar chart for confirmed cases, and a pie chart for vaccine rates - stating the completely vaccinated, partially vaccinated, and non-vaccinated per country.
