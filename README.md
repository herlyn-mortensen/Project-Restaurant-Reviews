# Project-Restaurant-Reviews


### PROJECT OVERVIEW

Potential customers will always put their trust in other customers before the establishment. That's the allure of social proof marketing. While your business's promotional and advertising activities will undoubtedly bring in new customers, nothing beats the support of existing customers who can attest to the quality of your items.

Users consider online reviews to be more credible than any other advertisement. The reviews will speak for themselves if the restaurants do their utmost to provide exceptional customer service. People now recommend restaurants to their friends and family based on online ratings.

This app targets food lovers and it focuses on online reviews of restaurants around the city.
